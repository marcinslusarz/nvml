To log syscalls made in the command 'make something':

INTERCEPT_LOG=intercepting.log LD_PRELOAD=./libcintercept.so make something

The environment variable INTERCEPT_LOG is used by the intercepting library
to name the log files. Each logfile create has a pid number attached to
the end of this given path. E.g. after make forking, creating three
processes altogether, the result would be three log files:

intercepting.log.3423
intercepting.log.3424
intercepting.log.3425

These logs contain one line per each syscall intercepted.
A line starts with the offset of the patched syscall instruction
in glibc, and continues with a short description of the syscall.

To decode each offset using addr2line, execute the logfile, e.g.:

./intercepting.log.3425

Currently, this is not easily readable, but that can change.
